Description of Soltions:

I have provided two different solutions. 

"Python_bash.sh" runs "File.py" ---> These solutions have variables that are passed in from the top of the .py script INSTEAD of the bash script (not using argparse)
"Python_bashEx2.sh" runs "FileEx2.py" ----> These solutions have variables that are passed in from the bash script into the python script (ie uses argparse)

Please look at both soltuions when you complete the project, as you should have explored all these ways of completing the given tasks!

Good Luck!
