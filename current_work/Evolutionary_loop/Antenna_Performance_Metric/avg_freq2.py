### Purpose:
## The goal of this program is to read gains from XF of antennas for each frequency so that
## the average gain can be compared between antennas at the same frequency.
#
#
#
#
#
## To run this script, pass the following arguments:
## 1. source (where the file is located)
## 2. destination (where to output any files from this program) **(currently not used)**
## 3. numFreqs -- The number of frequencies being checked **(currently not used)**
## 4. NPOP--the number of individuals you want to plot
#
## Run as follows:
## python3 avg_freq.py (source) (destination) (numFreqs) (NPOP)
## For example (from inside the run name directory):
## python3 ../../Antenna_Performance_Metric/avg_freq.py . . 60 10
