% June 1
\section{Thu}
\subsection{Bash}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item A little bit of Bash each day keeps the doctor away.
    In the main loop, around line 140, we have
    \begin{verbatim}
      read -p "Starting generation ${gen} at location ${state}.\
                 Press any key to continue... " -n1 -s  
    \end{verbatim}
    Option "-p <prompt>" outputs the "prompt" string before reading user input.\\
    Option "-n <number>" returns after reading the specified "number" of chars.\\
    Option "-s" does not echo the user's input.
\end{enumerate}

% June 2
\section{Fri}
\textit{On a flight home. Didn't do much except started going over Part B1 again}

% June 3
\section{Sat}
\subsection{Meeting with Julie}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The meeting this Wednesday was cancelled. In the meantime, Julie suggests reading
    the Appendix and her candidacy paper. I have largely finished reading the relevant
    part of the Appendix, so the rest of this week will most likely be spent reading
    the candidacy paper and checking out the "Loop Parts" in more detail.
  \item Part B1 second pass: will also check out the job submission script 
    this time around (final line of "Part_B_GPU_job_1.sh", but still not going
    to look into the xmacros).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Regex}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Started reading about regular expression, although perhaps not directly relevant
    to anything.
\end{enumerate}

% June 4
\section{Sun}
\subsection{Meeting with Julie}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Currently a bit confused by the job submission script "GPU_XF_job.sh"
  \item I think this is because I am not familiar enough with the file structure yet.
  \item Also, I am not entirely sure what the "individual number" is for in this script.
\end{enumerate}

% June 5
\section{Mon}
\subsection{Meeting with Julie}
\label{65S1}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Still on the job submission script of "Part B1". I am confused about when
    exactly are the "indiv_parent_dir" created 
    (the ones in \$"XFproj/Simulations")
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{SLURM}
  \textbf{Filename replacement} are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item "%x" - Job name, which can be given as \texttt{----job-name=<name>}
  \item "%a" - Job array ID (index) number
  \item "%A" - Job Array's master job allocation number
  \item More options here: \url{https://slurm.schedmd.com/sbatch.html}
\end{enumerate}

\noindent Note that the following are not the same:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \$"SLURM_ARRAY_JOB_ID": this is the "%A" from above
  \item \$"SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID": this is the index ("%a" from above)
\end{enumerate}


% June 6
\section{Tue}
\subsection{Meeting with Julie} 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Started reading Julie's candidacy paper.
\end{enumerate}

% June 7
\section{Wed}
\subsection{Meeting with Julie}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Read everything aside from Chapter 5.
  \item \textbf{TODO:} Go over Chapter 3 again before reading chapter 5.
  \item Ask Julie about Figure 6,7 8 and 9 (a discussion on all of chapter 3.1.2 if
    possible)
  \item \textbf{Zenith Angle:} The angle at which the muon traveled into the
    IceCube detector, with respect to the vertical. Source:
    \url{https://user-web.icecube.wisc.edu/~krosenau/index.html}

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Bash}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item A backtick is not a quotation mark. Instance: "Part_B_GPU_job1.sh" line 37
    \begin{verbatim}
      for i in `seq 1 $NPOP`
    \end{verbatim}
    Everything we type inside the backticks is executed before the main command
    (such as "chown"), and the output of the backticked-command is then read by
    the main command
\end{enumerate}

% June 8
\section{Thu}
\subsection{Meeting with Julie}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Regarding Part \ref{65S1} of the June 5th entry, from Alex: 
    \begin{quote}
    those are created by XF. Itâ€™s like a backend thing, we never make them
    ourselves but by virtue of simulating antennas they get made by XF as the
    location to store the antenna simulation data
    \end{quote}
    In other words, we do not ourselves "mkdir" the \$"indiv_dir_parent".

  \item Meeting with Julie today moved to Monday next week.

  \item \st{It seems unlikely to be a bug given how long this script has been used,
    but I am getting an error from the for loop through all frequencies in
    freqlist. Will ask Alex about it.}
    I'm an indiot. I need to initialize \$"GeoFactor" first.

  \item Finished "Loop_Parts/Part_B1" second pass, moving on to "Part_B2". Adding line
    breaks in the process; \textbf{Be careful with the trailing whitespace!}
    \textit{Mayhap it's better to just leave them as single long lines?}

  \item \textbf{TODO:} sometime in the future I'll need to figure out what 
    "simulation_PEC.xmacro" and "output.xmacro" do to really understand what "Part_B1" 
    and "Part_B2" are about.
\end{enumerate}

% June 9
\section{Fri}
\subsection{Meeting with Julie}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \st{Probably trivial, but it seems like the uan files are already being moved
    to the correct directory at the end of Part\_B2, so I am not sure why we do it
    again at the beginning of Part\_C.}
  \item One of the "mv" command might be extra; will check with Alex.
  \item "Part_C" second pass: digging into the python codes; should be able to finish
    by tomorrow.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Bash}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The dollar sign works inside the double quotes so there is no need for string
    concatenation in the example below:
    \begin{verbatim}
      $a=2;$b=2
      echo "a * b = $(($a*$b))"
    \end{verbatim}
    The above outputs "a * b = 4". Note that the \$((...)) part is for arithmetics.
  \item At some point I should try to figure out exactly what double quotes are for in
    shell scripts; they seem to be more than just strings?
    
\end{enumerate}

\section{Sat}
\subsection{Meeting with Amy}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Get in touch with Nicholas to see what he's up to.
  \item Go to Monday's collaboration meeting this week if possible to see if there's a 
    project for me.
