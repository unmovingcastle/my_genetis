\section{Thu}
\subsection{Bash}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item A little bit of Bash each day keeps the doctor away.
    In the main loop, around line 140, we have
    \begin{verbatim}
      read -p "Starting generation ${gen} at location ${state}.\
                 Press any key to continue... " -n1 -s  
    \end{verbatim}
    Option "-p <prompt>" outputs the "prompt" string before reading user input.\\
    Option "-n <number>" returns after reading the specified "number" of chars.\\
    Option "-s" does not echo the user's input.


\end{enumerate}

\section{Fri}
\textit{On a flight home. Didn't do much except started going over Part B1 again}

\section{Sat}
\subsection{Meeting with Julie}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The meeting this Wednesday was cancelled. In the meantime, Julie suggests reading
    the Appendix and her candidacy paper. I have largely finished reading the relevant
    part of the Appendix, so the rest of this week will most likely be spent reading
    the candidacy paper and checking out the "Loop Parts" in more detail.
  \item Part B1 second pass: will also check out the job submission script 
    this time around (final line of "Part_B_GPU_job_1.sh", but still not going
    to look into the xmacros).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Regex}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Started reading about regular expression, although perhaps not directly relevant
    to anything.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Sun}
\subsection{Meeting with Julie}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Currently a bit confused by the job submission script "GPU_XF_job.sh"
  \item I think this is because I am not familiar enough with the file structure yet.
  \item Also, I am not entirely sure what the "individual number" is for in this script.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Mon}
\subsection{Meeting with Julie}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Still on the job submission script of "Part B1". I am confused about when
    exactly are the "indiv_parent_dir" created 
    (the ones in \$"XFproj/Simulations")
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{SLURM}
  \textbf{Filename replacement} are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item "%x" - Job name, which can be given as \texttt{----job-name=<name>}
  \item "%a" - Job array ID (index) number
  \item "%A" - Job Array's master job allocation number
  \item More options here: \url{https://slurm.schedmd.com/sbatch.html}
\end{enumerate}

\noindent Note that the following are not the same:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \$"SLURM_ARRAY_JOB_ID": this is the "%A" from above
  \item \$"SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID": this is the index ("%a" from above)
\end{enumerate}



\section{Tue}
\subsection{Meeting with Julie} 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Started reading Julie's candidacy paper.
\end{enumerate}
