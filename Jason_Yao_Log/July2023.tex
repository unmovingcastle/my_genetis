\subsection{HPol Work}
\subsubsection{GA}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Back to going through the GA c++ files.
  \item There has to be a way to improve "DataRead()". The file currently has an "if" 
    check inside a "for" loop, probably not the most efficient way to do this.

    first column. \textbf{TODO:} figure out what the second column of "fitnessScores.csv"
    is (in PAEA there are three columns actually)
