\subsection{HPol Loop}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Working on HPol loop part A.
  \item TODO: learn about git "submodule" (for "Shared-Code/GA")
  \item From
    \url{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17683458/how-do-i-commit-case-sensitive-
    only-filename-changes-in-git}, regarding Github file name change:\\
    "git mv -f yOuRfIlEnAmE yourfilename"

\section{Tue}
\subsection{HPol Work}
\subsubsection{GA}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Back to going through the GA c++ files.
  \item There has to be a way to improve "DataRead()". The file currently has an "if" 
    check inside a "for" loop, probably not the most efficient way to do this.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Thu}
\subsection{HPol Work}
\subsubsection{GA: DataRead.h}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Finished modifying "DataRead.cpp" and pushed to Github.
  \item The part that reads "fitnessScores.csv" inside "DataRead.cpp" only reads the 
    first column. \textbf{TODO:} figure out what the second column of "fitnessScores.csv"
    is (in PAEA there are three columns actually)
\end{enumerate}

\section{Sat}
\subsection{HPol Work}
\subsubsection{GA: Sort.h}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Started modifying Sort.h.
\end{enumerate}

% June 9
\section{Sun}
\subsection{HPol Work}
\subsubsection{GA: Sort.h}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item "original_location" and "t" are probably not needed at all? Check again and
    get rid of these.
  \item Actually not sure where we obtain "parent_location". It doesn't seem like
    "DataRead.h" provides this vector. And the whole "original_location"-stuff just 
    seems weird. Is this part of the program incomplete?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Mon}
\subsection{HPol Work}
\subsubsection{GA: Sort.h}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Finished editing "Sort.h" and pushed to Github.
  \item Will discuss the issue mentioned in yesterday's log during the meeting today.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Monday's Meeting}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item From Ezio, regarding creating a remote "hpol" branch and allowing others to 
    review the changes:
    \begin{quote}
    you can push your local branch with ``git push origin your-branch'' and it
    will show you a link to create the PR on GitHub. Once you create the PR you
    can keep adding commits to the branch and push them and it will update the PR.
    \end{quote}
